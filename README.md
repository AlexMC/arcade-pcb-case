# arcade-pcb-case

Patters to build Arcade PCB cases.

You can use Crystal Acrylic of 4, 5 or 6 mm of thickness.

`_normal` files are for laser cut with engraved loggo from the outside of the case.

`_reverse` files are for laser cut with engraved loggo from the inside of the case.

`_m3` files are for M3 screw holes (3 mm).

`_m4` files are for M4 screw holes (4 mm).

The holes to mount a fan or cooler on boards like Killer Instinct are always 4M (4 mm) because that is the standard for those devices.
