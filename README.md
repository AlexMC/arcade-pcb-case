# arcade-pcb-case

Patterns to build Arcade PCB cases.

You can use Crystal Acrylic of 4, 5 or 6 mm of thickness.

![Example Case](./example_case.jpg)

`_normal` files are for laser cut with engraved loggo from the outside of the case.

`_reverse` files are for laser cut with engraved loggo from the inside of the case.

`_m3` files are for M3 screw holes (3 mm).

`_m4` files are for M4 screw holes (4 mm).

The holes to mount a fan or cooler on boards like Killer Instinct are always M4 (4 mm) because that is the standard for those devices.

## Materials needed

After laser cut and engrave the patterns on Acrylic, to assemble the case you will need:

Required for each mounting hole:

- 1x female-female hexagonal standoff (M3 or M4)
- 1x male-female hexagonal standoff (M3 or M4)
- 2x M3 or M4 screw (12 mm long)

Optional for each mounting hole:

- 2x M3 or M4 plastic washer (to better protect the PCB)
- 1x M3 or M4 plastic feet (to protect the case from scratches)
